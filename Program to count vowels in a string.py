# Given a string, count the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it. There are two methods to count total 
# number of vowels in a string. 

#using loop

#     for i in string:
#         for j in vowels:
#             if i == j:
#                 count += 1
#     print(count)

# checkVowels("aeiou")
